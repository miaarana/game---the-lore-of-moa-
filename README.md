# game--the-lore-of-moa-

This is my first video game that I will be creating on my own. It will be based on one of my favorite artist, Tomorrow X Together. They have a lore to their music vidoes which is super cool and intersecting and I would love to create a game revolving around their lore and members. 

I will be designing their characters and background but for now I want to have the base of the code so then I can focus on their character design, story plot, and more. I will be including all of this into the folder.
